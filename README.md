# ExpressJS-Blog-Website ❤️

Welcome to the Blog Website repository! This web application allows users to compose and publish blog posts. 
It is built using ExpressJS and EJS, leveraging the power of server-side rendering for dynamic content generation.

## Features ✅

- **Templating**: The website uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML pages.

- **Multiple Views**: The application includes various views such as the Home page, Compose page, and individual blog post pages.

- **Routing**: ExpressJS is used to implement GET and POST routes for handling requests and rendering appropriate views.

- **Compose Page**: Users can create and submit blog posts through the Compose page.

- **Home Page**: The Home page displays all published blog posts, allowing users to read and navigate to individual posts.

- **Individual Blog Pages**: Each blog post has its own dedicated page accessible through its title, enabling users to view and share specific posts.
